# Our React App Tutorial

This is a simple guide to run a React application that utilizes `react-router-dom` for routing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Basic understanding of npm (Node Package Manager).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
3. Install dependencies using npm:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
   This will install all required dependencies, including `react`, `react-router-dom`, and others listed in `package.json`.

## Running the App

To run the app locally, use the following npm command:

        
    npm run dev
        
    
This will run the app on your local host. Follow instructions displayed in your terminal.
